# Bus Tracking Mobile App Architecture

## Overview
A real-time bus tracking mobile application that allows parents to monitor their children's school bus location with live updates and notifications.

## Architecture Pattern
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers
- **BLoC Pattern**: State management for reactive UI updates
- **Repository Pattern**: Data abstraction layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components

## Core Features
1. **Real-time Bus Tracking**: GPS location updates every 30 seconds
2. **Parent Dashboard**: Live map view with bus location
3. **Push Notifications**: Bus arrival/departure alerts
4. **Route Management**: Predefined bus routes and stops
5. **Student Management**: Parent can track multiple children
6. **Driver Interface**: Simple location broadcasting interface

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State Management**: flutter_bloc
- **Maps**: Google Maps / OpenStreetMap
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket / Firebase Realtime Database
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Location Services**: Geolocator
- **Backend**: Firebase (or Node.js REST API)
- **Database**: Firestore / PostgreSQL

## App Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Screens**: UI pages (Dashboard, Login, Profile, etc.)
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components
- **BLoCs**: Business logic and state management

### 2. Domain Layer
- **Entities**: Core business objects (Bus, Route, Student, Parent)
- **Use Cases**: Business logic operations
- **Repository Interfaces**: Data access contracts

### 3. Data Layer
- **Repositories**: Implementation of data access
- **Data Sources**: Remote (API) and Local (Cache/Database)
- **Models**: Data transfer objects

### 4. Core Layer
- **Constants**: App-wide constants
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Services**: Location, notification, authentication services

## User Roles

### Parent App Features
- Login/Authentication
- Dashboard with live bus location
- Multiple children tracking
- Notification preferences
- Bus route information
- Estimated arrival times
- Emergency contact integration

### Driver App Features
- Simple login interface
- Start/Stop tracking button
- Route assignment
- Emergency alert system
- Basic navigation assistance

## Real-time Communication Flow
1. Driver app broadcasts GPS coordinates
2. Backend processes and stores location data
3. Parent apps receive real-time updates via WebSocket
4. UI updates automatically with new bus position
5. Notifications sent based on proximity to stops

## Security Considerations
- Secure authentication (OAuth/JWT)
- Location data encryption
- Parent-child relationship verification
- Driver authorization and verification
- Data privacy compliance (COPPA for children's data)

## Scalability Features
- Microservices architecture ready
- Horizontal scaling support
- Caching strategies for map data
- Load balancing for real-time connections
- Database sharding for large user bases
